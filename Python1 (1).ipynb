        "*   Python is an object oriented, high level, general purpose programming language.\n",
        "*   It's easy to use and understand, readability and simplicity makes it popular and vivid amongst programmers.\n",
        "*   It uses interpreter which converts high level language into machine language line by line and execute it immediately letting the programmer know  the errors\n",
        "*   Comes with an extensive standard library, providing pre-built functionalities, which saves time and effort of programmer.\n",
